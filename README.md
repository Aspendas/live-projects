# Live Projects

This repository showcases the projects that I have developed, but I don't want to share the code with the open-source community.

## Erasmus Experiences Website

This project aims to list the Erasmus exchange experiences of previous outgoing students for the benefit of other students and used by the METU International Cooperations Office.

### Technologies Used

- **Firestore Database:** Created from an Excel file.
- **User Interface:** Developed using Next.js and TailwindCSS.
- **Filtering:** Users can filter experiences by school and country.
