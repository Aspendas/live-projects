# Live Projects

This repository showcases the projects that I have developed, but I don't want to share the code with the open-source community.

## METURackets

This project aims to manage the competitive/non-competitive racket sport leagues and tournaments. The objective is to increase the students level by adding competition between each other. The METU Tennis society is also supporting the website to use it for leagues.

Technologies Used

PostgreSQL
User Interface: Developed using Next.js, TailwindCSS and Shadcn.
Resend: Created an automatized email system for matches leagues etc.
